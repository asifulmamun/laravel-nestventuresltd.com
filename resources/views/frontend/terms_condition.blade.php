        <h1>Return and Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>At NEST, we prioritize transparency and flexibility in our investment processes. Our return and refund policy is designed to ensure clarity and confidence for all our investors. Below are the key aspects of our policy:</p>

    <h2>Standard Return Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Project Completion:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For each project, a deed is created specifying the investment terms and duration.</li>
                <li>Upon the completion of the project term, the invested amount will be returned to investors.</li>
                <li>This process typically takes up to one month post-completion to liquidate and distribute the funds.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Urgent Withdrawal Requests</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Urgent Withdrawals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In cases where there is an urgent need to withdraw funds before the project completion, investors can request an urgent withdrawal.</li>
                <li>Standard urgent withdrawals are processed within two to six months, as per the terms outlined in the project deed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Accelerated Urgent Withdrawals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For more pressing needs, we offer an option to expedite the process by seeking a replacement investor.</li>
                <li>If an alternative investor is found who can match the initial investment, we can process the refund as quickly as possible.</li>
                <li>The timeline for this expedited process depends on finding a suitable replacement investor, but we aim to facilitate this swiftly to meet urgent needs.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
